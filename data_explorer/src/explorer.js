For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. So \"external\" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. \n\nOther backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like \"oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common\" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father.\n\nAlso, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations. In such way the sampling ~~bias~~ might affect your conclusions (If by chance you are in front of one of the few redhead from population X that hasn't anything to do with a shared origin with that subject).\n\n**Edit #2** There is no huge amount of genes that determine the physical appearance. And said gene/traits are the blank of strong sexual selection (let's say you prefer wide hips now). You are going to try to find a mate with wide hips regardless her ancestry whether she is from irish, italian or spanish ancestry (yeah I picked an actual example that could occur in my city/country). Then in a matter of few generations said traits are diluted or detached of some signal of ancestry (yeah you can actually say those hips look like someone from South America but that is all the \"geographical context\" you can provide or infer).

Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning . At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words . Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil . It is also an emblem of the Christian 's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ , the resurrection of the dead , and the final judgment of humankind .
